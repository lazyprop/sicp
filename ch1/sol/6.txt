this problem challenges the claim that the if clause needs to be a special form.

since new-if is a normal procedure, due to the applicative-order evaluation
model of scheme, when sqrt-iter is called then-clause and else-clause are
evaluated before they are passed as arguments to new-if. the else clause calls
back to sqrt-iter which in turn tries to evaluate new-if and evaulates
then-clause and else-clause first and so on

this infinite recursion results in a "recursion depth exceeded error"
