Explicit dispatch allows to add new operations without changing the existing
code. A new operation is simply a new proceure definition which does explicit
dispatching.

Message passing style makes it slightly hard to add operations on existing
types. We would have to change all the old code. If we implement a new
operation, we will have to go to the defintion of each existing type and add
a condition there for that  operation.

In the message passing style we can add new types without changing any of the
old code.

Data-directed style allows to add new operations as a new operation is just
another entry in the table. For each type we have to define the operation and
`put` it into the lookup table.

Data-directed style also allows us to add new types. A new type is just a new
column to the table. We can define it without changing the old code and `put` it
into the table.
